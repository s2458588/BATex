\section{Target Languages}
\label{sec:target-languages}

Describe german (ISO639-3: deu) and its morphological state. Compare to other languages with interlinear glossing.

This section identifies target languages that share common morphological features with German.
German (ISO639-3: \texttt{deu}) is a west-germanic language and the official language of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxemburg (\cite{METZLER2016}).
It is an inflectional synthetic language with approximately 130 million speakers\footnote{https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1119851/umfrage/deutschsprachige-menschen-weltweit/ Last accessed: 09.01.23}.
German is largely researched and is still paid much attention to in the scientific community.
The aim is not to propose yet another case study of German, but to introduce German as a surrogate to further the scope of application on similar languages.
Presumably those languages behave similarly when analyzed morphologically.

\subsection{Pooling similar languages}
\label{subsec:german-as-example}



On one hand, linguistic typology has come up with many useful classifications for languages.
On the other, in the pursuit of reconstructing languages Indo-European studies have established a widely accepted phylogenetic model of the diachronic dependecy of Indo-European languages.
Both disciplines contribute to language classicifications that are used in this subsection.

Morphological complexity is a term to describe how languages use paradigms to connect grammatical information with lexemic information (\cite{MORPHOLOGICALCOMPLEXITY}).
Mind that morphological complexity is a nominal category to describe gradients of function-to-morpheme correspondence (\textbf{QUELLE}, not a qualitative assessment.
The common denominators that make languages morphologically complex are their morphological features.
Those languages that use affixation, fusion, composition and derivation (among others) are all fit candidates compared to german.

A summary of morphological typology is provided in ~\cite*[78--93]{LINGUISTICTYPOLOGY}).


Thus, German will be the exemplary target language for the experimental setup.
