This thesis showcases the use of specific intervention in tokenization subsystems of machine learning.
The intent of this thesis is to inject linguistic bias into the machine learning framework of BERT to sharpen the analytical capacities of a masked language model.
In this chapter the background, intentions and scope of the thesis are covered.


\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
There is an ongoing urge in the \acf{cl} community to understand natural language.
Research in the past decades shows use of frequentist and statistical methods (such as GPT (\cite{gpt}) and bert \cite{ATTENTION}) to their advantage, leading to the emergence of the first machine learning (ML) models.
It became apparent that these ML models are the best currently available approach to an automated understanding of natural language.
The structural parallels of machine learning to human learning have often been drawn (\uppercase{zitation)}) to demonstrate how similar and more importantly: how different both can be.
A powerful feature of \ac{ml} (as opposed to human learning) is the possibility of actively controlling the the learning parameters in a supervised environment.
To test the efficiency of \uppercase{ML} parameters a variety of tasks (\uppercase{zitation}) are designed and applied.
A trained model will yield performance scores based on the quality of its training, much like humans on language tests.
But the automated modeling of language is not the first instance of language modelling in a broader sense.
Traditional linguistics (\uppercase{definition} has produced fundamental research the prior to the discovery of \uppercase{ML} architectures and their implementation.
While generic ML frameworks seem appealing in the presumption that they require less work to reach somewhat satisfactoy results,
their performance is still incomplete.
The integration of aforementioned traditional linguistic knowledge into learning processes for machine learning is the underlying motivation of this thesis.


\textbf{flota} \cite{FLOTA}
Language learners usually build up a lexicon consisting of lexemes which they will have to analyze accurately in order to be productive in that target language.
A ML model relies on a tokenizer to create such a vocabulary  (\textbf{ZITATION}).
It is programmed to segment tokens into subwords (if possible) and provide a vocabulary comprising all the components needed to analyze a given string.
Ideally those subwords will be part of the functional vocabulary in the target language, which would make them a morphemes \textbf{ERKLÃ„RUNG}.
A morpheme is canonically defined as the smallest unit carrying meaning in a language \cite{morpheme}.
The problem of captchuring lexical morphemes at the tokenization level is a problem of morphological analysis.
A standard approach implemented in the BERT architecture is WordPiece tokenization, which takes pairs of ngrams and calculates a score based on the overall frequency in the text as well as cooccurrences.
This was idea pioneered by Schuster and Nakajima (\citeyear{WORDPIECEOG}) to deal with the problem of near infinite vocabularies and was later adopted in a google research project designing the final WordPiece algorithm ~\cite{WORDPIECEGOOGLE}.
WordPiece is designed to find the most effective pairs of subwords in a corpus to optimize vocabulary size.
Subwords however are not necessarily a productive component of inventory that is used for inflectional morphology.
In fact, the morphemes of a language and its generated tokenizer vocabulary  coincide.


Following the guiding principle that \textbf{input quality is ouput quality} not only in language learning, the morpheme vocabulary is identified as the point of leverage in the upcoming section.
Note: explain why i use tokens and words, they are interchangeable right?
holistic, need less attention to produce satisfactory
\uppercase{not just to push F, but to find a viable method of morphemic tokenization}


\section{Hypotheses}

\section{Scope and Structure}
\label{sec:scope-and-structure}

The following chapters are sorted into three parts.
To outline the research domain, a brief summary of the current state of morphological language modeling is given.
Next, german is described paying special attention to its morphological complexity and peer languages.
This serves as preface to the methodology, connecting characteristically matching languages to form a pool of possible  target languages.

As main part of this thesis the methodology for a new tokenization method is layed out.
It is sectioned into a theoretical part which focuses on the architecture of its components and the value they hold towards lexicalizing a tokenizer.
The implementation of each part in the tokenization process is explained next.
